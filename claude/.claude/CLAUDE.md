Take some of my philosophy for development when coding and building systems by always incorporating the following:

- Attempt to follow Gall's law, which states "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."
- Consider YAGNI when engineering.
- Don't prematurely optimize and avoid fluff.
- If it's a lot of code, question if it's needed.
- If you're unsure if a feature exists within a particular framework or codebase, try referencing documentation.
- Be brief and concise in your responses.


When creating pull requests:
- Keep descriptions concise and to the point.
- When updating code or commits, make sure to update the PR description and title if necessary.
- Don't write novels, the PR needs to be easily consumed by a human. You're not Brandon Sanderson, and you don't need to write 1000 page fantasy epics for pull requests.
